                <div class="padadjust"><h2>Motivation</h2>
                    Multi-contrast Jones matrix tomography (MC-JMT) is a variant of optical coherence tomography, which provides a
                    structural OCT, Doppler OCT and polarization sensitive OCT by a single volumetric scan. Recent development of
                    advanced MC-JMT has enabled clinical examination of posterior eye and MC-JMT showed its high clinical utility.
                    Since MC-JMT provides multiple images with multiple contrasts, a clinician is required to read and understand all
                    images with multiple contrasts properly in order to utilize the full advantage of the multi-contrast images. It is, in
                    practice, time consuming and the learning curve of the images reading skill is steep. And hence a proper automated
                    analysis for multi-contrast images is required. <br> So to extract a better use of the images and the information that is contained in MC-JMT data, here we
                    demonstrate a new five-dimensional (5-D) image analysis method.

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <div class="padadjust">
                    Our strategy for the image processing of MC-JMT consists of three steps. In the <b>first step</b>, all the MC-JMT
                    pixels are clustered in a 5-D feature space where the features are the three optical features and two spatial positions, i.e.,
                    transversal and depth-positions. The clusters obtained in this step are utilized as ROAs in the subsequent steps. In the
                    <b>second step</b>, the optical features are averaged over each ROA, i.e., cluster. This averaging reduces the variation of optical
                    properties within each tissue type. Finally, in the <b>third step</b>, the clusters of the pixels are classified into several tissue
                    types by a decision-tree algorithm which is a threshold based step-wise classification using the three optical properties.

                    <h3>First Step</h3>
                    The multi-contrast signal obtained by the MC-JMT was analyzed by a modified superpixel algorithm
                        which is based on <a href="http://ivrl.epfl.ch/research/superpixels">SLIC superpixel algorithm</a>.

                    The SLIC superpixel algorithm has been developed to analyze a standard digital color image. In this algorithm,
                    clusters of pixels, so called as superpixels, are generated by clustering pixels based on their color similarity and spatial
                    proximity in a 5-D feature space. The 5-D feature space constitutes the three color parameters in the CIELAB color
                    space and the two spatial coordinates of the given color image. <br>

                    <h3>Second Step</h3>
                    After obtaining the superpixels in the first step, the scattering OCT intensity, power Doppler and DOPU signals are
                        averaged within each superpixel. It is noteworthy that the averaged power Doppler signal equals to the local variance of
                        Doppler phase shift under assumption of zero-mean of Doppler phase shift.

                    <h3>Third Step</h3>
                    The each superpixel was classified into four tissue classes; blood vessels, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),
                        exudation, and other tissue. The superpixel which was classified into none of these four classes is classified as noise
                        class.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    This analysis provides clusters of MC-JMT pixels and
                    the clusters are utilized as region-of-interest (ROI) for further image processing. In particular, this ROI is utilized for
                    averaging of MC-JMT image. The averaging found to reduce the noise and speckle of the MC-JMT as preserving
                    significant structural features of a sample. The averaged MC-JMT data is further processed by a simple decision-tree
                    based tissue classification algorithm. Qualitative assessment showed the improvement of sensitivity and specificity of the
                    tissue classification by the 5-D analysis and consequent averaging. <br>

                    With the increase in the number of superpixels, we can increase the reliability over the structural features of the MCJMT
                    images. This is evidently shown in the Figure 4. <br>
                    One evident shortcoming of our current implementation is the unoptimized definition of the distance in the 5-D
                    feature space. Further development of a method which strategically optimizes the balance among the features in
                    calculation of the distance would provide more appropriate ROA. <br>

                    The ROA obtained by superpixel analysis is applicable to not only averaging but also other types of local
                    statistics. It would be useful, in the future, for quantification of multi-contrast OCT images, such as quantification of
                    birefringence or Doppler flow, where definition of local region to calculate local statistics directly affects to the
                    quantification accuracy.
