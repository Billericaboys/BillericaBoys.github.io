				<div class="padadjust"><h2>Motivation</h2>
					Vision-based systems for smart parking lot management have attracted great attention in recent years.
					This systems are mainly challenged by dramatic lighting variations, shadows cast on the scene, varying perspective distortion
					in the image and inter-object occlusion among parked cars and the ground plane, insufficient illumination during night time.
					Literature study shows that related algorithms can be broadly classified into car-oriented methods,
					space-oriented methods, hybrid methods and parking-lot-oriented methods.
					For such surveillance applications, we have to continuously monitor the parking lot and processing a raw video output is computationally costly.
					<br><br>
					In the field of video surveillance, we have a huge amount of redundant and sparse data in the form of images.
					Compressive sensing is a robust and scalable sensing technique which can exploit the sparsity of a signal to compress it. In this study, my promary goal
					is to evaluate the technical feasibility and advantages observed if Compressive sensing is applied to traditional Parking-lot-oriented method of vacant
					parking space detection system.

				<h2>Theory</h2>

					<h3>Surface-Based Parking Lot Structure</h3>

					For car-oriented approaches, which tend to capture the texture characteristics of vehicles, seem to provide suitable solutions to handling the occlusion and
					shadow effects. In contrast, the space-oriented approaches, which were designed to analyze the texture of the image area
					corresponding to a vacant parking space, can better handle the perspective distortion by adding 3-D scene information. Hence,
					if we can find a way to benefit from both kinds of approaches, we may achieve robust performance.

				In terms of car-oriented approaches, systems usually check the image area, as shown in Figure 1(a), to check the existence
				of a car. As for the space-oriented approaches, the pixel-based or texture-based feature inside the region of a parking space is
				used for analysis, as shown in Figure 1(b). In comparison, our approach treats the parking spaces as a set of cubes, as
				illustrated in Figure 1(c). Each cube is composed of six patches like Figure 1(d). If looking into the details, we may
				find that the ground plane of a parking space is the ground patch, while a car is made up of patches. Thus, we suggest
				using surfaces to represent the parking lot structure so that we can benefit from both the car-oriented and space-oriented methods.

				<br><br>
				For a structural parking lot, we may detect the status of each parking space by observing occlusion patterns inside each
				image patch. To be specific, we demonstrate various kinds of patterns inside different projection patches in Figure 2. In total,
				there are 14 different patterns. Here, owing to the regularity of occlusion patterns among objects, an image patch presents
				distinguishable textures for vacant space detection. Thus, a direct method to determine the parking statuses is to classify
				the selected patches into one of the 14 occlusion patterns.

					<h3>Compressive Sensing</h3>

						Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique for efficiently acquiring
						and reconstructing a signal, by finding solutions to underdetermined linear systems. This is based on the principle that, through optimization,
						the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.
						There are two conditions under which recovery is possible. The first one is sparsity which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain.
						The second one is incoherence which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals. A tutorial on Compressive sensing application
						for video can be found <a href=" http://www.ece.rice.edu/~as48/VideoCS2012Tutorial/">here</a>.


					<h3>Compressive Tracking</h3>

						Tracking algorithms can be generally categorized as either Generative(Generative tracking algorithms typically learn a model to represent the target
						object and then use it to search for the image region with minimal reconstruction
						error.) or Discriminative(Discriminative algorithms pose the tracking problem as a binary classification
						task in order to find the decision boundary for separating the target object from
						the background.) based on their appearance models.
						<br>
						<a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/CT/eccv_ct_camera.pdf">Compressive Tracking algorithm</a> is an effective and efficient tracking algorithm with
						an appearance model based on features extracted in the compressed domain.
						The main components of compressive tracking algorithm are shown by Figure 3.

					This appearance model is generative as the object can be well represented
					based on the features extracted in the compressive domain. It is also discriminative
					because it uses these features to separate the target from the surrounding
					background via a naive Bayes classifier. In this appearance model, features
					are selected by an information-preserving and non-adaptive dimensionality reduction
					from the multi-scale image feature space based on compressive sensing
					theories.
