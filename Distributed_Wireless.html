					A distributed Wi-Fi monitoring system is designed to monitor wireless networks operating on the 2.4 GHz ISM radio band. 
					The Wi-Fi monitoring system consists of multiple monitoring devices and each monitoring device extracts the MAC address 
					and RSSI measurement for every monitored packet. Each wireless device is identified by its unique MAC address and
					RSSI values belonging to a particular device are grouped together based on its MAC address.
					The purpose of the system is to acquire the field measurements of the RSSI values of observed devices under different 
					radiation characteristics of the sensing antennas. 
					<br><br>
					The experiment was implemented inside a 50 m × 50 m open space area in the parking lot 100j at Texas A\&M university.
					In this experimental setting, the target area At is considered to be a square of dimension 20 m × 20 m inscribed in a 
					larger square of dimension 50 m × 50 m.  The distributed monitoring system consists of four monitoring devices placed 
					at the corners of the target area and a central server to integrate the information from all monitoring devices

<h3>Monitoring Devices</h3>
Every monitoring device takes the form of a dedicated Next Unit of Computing
(NUC) by Intel™ and it runs an instance of GNU/Linux as its operating system. Each
NUC is equipped with two external wireless network interface cards with detachable 
antennas. Wireless monitoring is enabled by setting these external network cards to monitoring
mode. The functionality of an NUC is to decode the packets captured by the network
interface cards and also to filter and store the packet information in a database. For this,
a custom software is developed in C language using the pcap application programming
interface (API). This software deciphers the transmitter MAC address and the RSSI information
from the captured packets. For every pertinent packet, it stores the retrieved
information along with the time stamp of the packet capture to a local SQLite database.
This software filters redundant data using a hash table, which naturally removes duplicates
within detected MAC addresses. The monitoring device set up is shown in Fig

	<br><br>
	<h3>Monitoring Antennas</h3>
	<br>
In this experimental setup, Alfa™ AWUS036NHA wireless interfaces are used as the
external network cards. It enables operators to launch IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless network
at 150 Mbps in the 2.4GHz band, which is also compatible with IEEE 802.11b/g wireless
devices at 54 Mbps. These interfaces are composed of a detachable antenna and an
Atheros™ chipset. The Atheros™ chipset provides two modes of operation - Managed
and Monitor. In monitoring mode, the chipset is capable of listening to all traffic present
on a channel in a 2.4 GHz band.
The default antennas of the network cards attached to the NUC are replaced with
custom designed isotropic and directional patch antennas. The custom designed antennas
are depicted in Fig. 5.1. To reduce noise levels, the antennas are placed at a height of
5 ft from the ground using dowels and mounts for the NUCs. The mounts for the NUCs
are designed using SolidWorks, and they are 3D printed with a Makerbot-2 device. The
antennas are placed at different heights to reduce coupling among them. The NUCs are
powered with extension cables using an inverter from a car.

<br><br>
	<h3>Central Server</h3>
	<br> 
The central server is designed to collect and integrate information from all monitoring
devices. In the experimental setup, the transfer of information from monitoring devices
to the central server is made via the TCP protocol. At the central server, each wireless device
is identified by its unique MAC address, and RSSI values belonging to a particular
device are grouped together based on its MAC address. The fusion center possesses side
information in the form of the locations of sensing devices, their orientations and antenna
properties. We use this data for multiple purposes, for example to study the effect of using directional and omni-directional
antennae in the network cards and to compare their classification performance on the observed
devices
<br><br>
	<h3>Wireless Agents</h3>
	<br>

									<h6 align="center"> Experimental Area</h6>

								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
The wireless agents are Android™ smartphones and laptops with isotropic antennas.
In this study, we assume that the wireless users are quasistatic and an inference task is
performed over a single monitoring period. Although it is possible to incorporate moving
agents and streaming observations into the problem formulation, these features render the
analysis more challenging and they are not necessary to achieve our goal of better understanding
the interplay between antenna profiles and RF monitoring. As such, advanced
mobility models and their ramifications are relegated to future work in favor of a simpler,
explicative model suited to our main purpose.
Throughout the course of the experiment, every wireless unit runs a custom app,
which logs GPS coordinates and time. The app is required to establish a ground truth
about each location. All the agents are operating on the same wireless network, and they
periodically transmit the information collected by the app to a central location. MAC addresses
and time stamps are then used to match locations to power vectors at the inference
center, thereby establishing the desired ground truth.

<h3>Experimental Samples</h3>

Altogether, the experimental set contains approximately 800 power and location vectors
for monitoring devices with isotropic antennas, and another 800 power and location
vectors for a system with directional antennas. Since there are four monitoring devices,
this is equivalent to 6,400 distinct points. For every location inside the overall region, the
signal strengths received at the four monitoring units are aggregated into a single vector
p, which serves as input to the classification algorithms. The estimates are then compared
with the ground truth derived from the known locations. The locations of the data points
obtained from the field experiment are shown in Fig. 5.2. The red marks indicate the locations
of monitoring units and the green dots indicate the locations of the collected data
points.
